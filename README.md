The data set used is from the World Bank, collected as part of a pilot study on the feasibility of crowd-sourced price data collection. Price data was collected by non-professionals for thirty specific food items across several months in eight countries. The Excel file contains geographic data (city and country), time data (date of observation), product information (name, quantity) and price (standardized quantities, prices converted to comparable currency).

The tableau file contains the following visualizations and observations:

-Plot countries as a map

-To analyze how much variation is there in product prices across each country throughout the 4 years.
